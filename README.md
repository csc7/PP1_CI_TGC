# TGC - The Green Company
This repository belongs to my first milestone project in the Full-stack Development course at Code Institute, covering HTML and CSS along with Git version control and other design tools.

# Project Goals
The goals of the project is to develop a website for a company that provides several geophysical services for diverse projects in the curren energy transition towards greener energies and less CO2 emissions.

Specifically, the goals are the following ones:
* To show all services that the company offers.
* To offer the company a simple way of being contacted.
* To offer the company a simple way of selling services.
* To provide users a clear view of the services available.
* To provide users a simple way of requesting services.
* to provide users a simple way of contacting the company.

# User Goals
* A website where navigation is easy and intuitive.
* Capability of show the same information, in the same easy and intuitive way, in different devices and screen sizes.
* Rather than a description of the service, a fast way of requesting the service.
* A simple way of contacting the company.
* An option where a user is able to give personal details while keeping the decision of opting out of marketing communications. 

# User Stories
* "Our wind energy company is small in size and benefits from flexible procedures for contracting services; we want a website like the one of The Green Company that offers them with a quick way of contracting, so that we can address our project requests very quickly and agilely".
* "We are a manpower company that needs to respond to client requests as quick as possible, with as many services as possible; we see The Green Company's website a convenient way to select and hire different types of geophysical services".
* "I am a consultant who sometimes needs to build dedicated teams to address service requests for specific projects (most of them in the study of grounds for solar projects); I see The Green Company as an excellent way to get information about available services without the need of going through long processes and without the need of exchanging personal data (which many times is confidential due to the nature of the projects I work in)".
* "Our company deals with many energy projects (most of then in the geothermal and eolic energy spectrum) and we find the website of The Green Company a quick and convenient way of having a summary of most required services, with the additional benefit of contracting them directly".

# Site Owner Goals
* To show all services that the company offers in a summarised way.
* To offer a quick way to contract services (to add value when compared to other companies and to increase chances of capturing clients not fully decided).
* To receive consultations from potential clients.
* To capture clients.
* To sell services.
* To show in the home page an introduction and a few words about what the company is.

* To provide a simple contact form where the client feels that privacy is respected.
* To offer a quick option, through a button, to contract services.

# User Requirements and Expectations
* To find a website that summarises as many geophysical services as possible.
* To have the option to contact the company without getting into complex processes, while mantaining the option to avoid unsolicited marketing communications.
* To be able to easily contact services if needed.

# Structure
Following expectations of the owner, the metadata includes the following keywords to help search engines to find the website: geophysics, services, modelling, acquisition, processing, wind, geothermal, carbon, capture, CO2, operations. In addition, to help find the developer and this project, the following keywords are added: Code Institute, software development, student, full-stack course, milestone project.

In order to achive the goals related to easiness and/or simplicity, a navigation area in the header is provided. In the same area, the company's logo is place to the left, and a "quick" button to request services on the right, so users are able to contract services in a very fast way.

This "quick" button, whose name is "Request Service", pops up a modal form where the user is able to contract specific services.

The body of the pages are structured as follows for each of the pages:
* Home: it contains a typical picture of a geophysical service with a brief introduction of what the company is able to offer.\
To keep navigation simple, this page is designed to fit in a screen of 1024x768 pixels withough having to scroll with the mouse.
* About Us: it has an upper section, divided in three subsections, where a picture, title and text for the following items are allocated: Mission, Values and Vision. In order to keep symmetry as accurate as possible, Values (which are shown in a list) are located in the middle.\
This section is followed, downwards, by another section (which lies in the middle of the body) that contains a table with the projects of the company.\
Finally, at the bottom of the body, there is another section that contains a table that shows the amount of people per department in the company.\
The desined is carried out for a screen size of 1024x1536 pixels (double in vertical lenght than the home page).
* Our services: it contains pictures, titles and text for each of the services being provided by the company. They are structured in a 4x4 arrange for desktop presentation, 2x8 for tablets, and 1x16 for mobile devices.\
For the desktop case, the desined is carried out for a screen size of 1024x1536 pixels (as before, double, in vertical lenght, than the home page).
* Contact Us: on the left, it has a picture of the office (above) and a location map (below). On the right, there is a form where the users are able to send consultations. It has options to avoid marketing communications and being contacted by telephone, as expected by users.\
Similar to the home page, to keep navigation simple, this page is designed to fit in a screen of 1024x768 pixels withough having to scroll with the mouse.

The footer contains links for social media, office location and company's principal e-mail of contact.
# Wireframes
Wireframes were developed at the beginning of the project with Balsamic Wireframes software. The first design was carried out for desktop devices, assuming a screen size of 1024x768 pixels.\
