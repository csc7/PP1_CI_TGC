# TGC - The Green Company
This website is about a fictitious company. Excpet for the contect referenced in this README file, all content is invented by me, anything matching reality is jsut a coincidence.

This repository belongs to my first milestone project in the Full-stack Development course at Code Institute, covering HTML and CSS along with Git version control and other design tools.

The live link for this projects is [this one](https://csc7.github.io/PP1_CI_TGC/).

# 2. User Experience

UX has been addressed (and remains as a constant activity) around Jesse James Garrett's process, whose five planes involves the following matters:
- STRATEGY: to build a website (product) for a company who wants to sell services.
- SCOPE: the minimum viable product needs to include features that allow the user to know the following:
    - Basic organisational information about the company.
    - Which services it provides.
    - How to contat the company.

    - How to request services: in a fixed button.
    - Be informed about the lastest news: in the home page.

# 3.  Design Choices
## Colors
Green is the main color of the project. The reason for this selection is to be in line with the nature of the company (whose services are focused in the current transition energy) and with the name of the company: The Green Company.

The background color is green/grey, rgb(186, 233, 227), in order to have contrast with the content of the website while keeping the green-color tendency of the design.
## Fonts
Google fonts (please see credits section below) were implemented in the website. Roboto was selected for the paragraph as it is modern and easy to read. Following Google's recommendations, Baloo Tammudu 2 was also selected as complement for the titles.
Arial font is used as a back-up in case the previous fonts cannot be loaded.

Color #003300 (dark green) was selected for the body in order to have strong contrast with the white background of the body.
To differentiate the navigation menu and the request service button,  #135f13 (different dark green) is selected; while #276609 is selected to highlight all headings.

The name of the company in the logo uses #73ac3e to have a unique color.
## Structure
Following expectations of the owner, the metadata includes the following keywords to help search engines to find the website: geophysics, services, modelling, acquisition, processing, wind, geothermal, carbon, capture, CO2, operations. In addition, to help find the developer and this project, the following keywords are added: Code Institute, software development, student, full-stack course, milestone project.

The name of the company along with the name of the page are included in the head element (in the title) in order to comply with the expectations of the owner.

The visible websites is organised in a header, a body and a footer.

Wireframes were developed at the beginning in order to have a first design of the website.

- ### Header

In order to achive the goals related to easiness and/or simplicity, a fixed navigation area in the header is provided. In the same area, the company's logo is place to the left, and a "quick" button to request services on the right, so users are able to contract services in a very fast way.

This "quick" button, whose name is "Request Service", pops up a modal form (taken from Bootstrap, please see credits section below) where the user is able to contract specific services.

- ### Body

The body of the pages are structured as follows for each of the pages:
* Home: it contains an environmental-friendly background video with a slogan of the company and the services it offers.
* About Us: it has an upper section, divided in three subsections, where a picture, title and text for Mission, Values and Vision are allocated.\
In order to keep symmetry as accurate as possible, Values (which are shown in a list) are located in the middle.\
This section is followed, downwards, by another section (which lies in the middle of the body) that contains a table with the last projects of the company (those in year 2021).\
Finally, at the bottom of the body, there is another section that contains a table that shows the amount of people per department in the company.\
The desined is carried out for a screen size of 1024x1536 pixels (double in vertical lenght than the home page).
* Our services: it contains pictures in a carousel (taken from Bootstrap, please see credit sections below).\
Below, in a section, there are columns that contain the titles of the services and text for each of them.\
They are structured in a 3x2 arrange for desktop and tablet presentations, and 1x6 for mobile devices.\
* Contact Us: on the left, there is a form where the users are able to send consultations. It has options to avoid marketing communications and being contacted by telephone, as expected by users.\
On the right, there is a map of the office (above) and contact details can be found below the map.\
This page has a background picture of the office.

- ### Footer

The footer contains links for social media, office location and company's principal e-mail of contact.\

- ### Wireframes
Wireframes were developed at the beginning of the project with Balsamic Wireframes software. The first design was carried out for desktop devices, assuming a screen size of 1024x768 pixels.
