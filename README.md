# **2 . User Experience**

UX has been addressed (and remains as a constant activity) around Jesse James Garrett's process, whose five planes involves the following matters:
- **STRATEGY**: to build a website (product) for a company who wants to sell services.
- **SCOPE**: the minimum viable product needs to include features that allow the user to know the following:
    - Basic organisational information about the company.
    - Which services it provides.
    - How to contat the company.
    - How to request services.
    - Be informed about the lastest news.
- **STRUCTURE**: the information is structured as follows:
    - Basic organisational information about the company: in a separate page.
    - Which services it provides: in a separate page.
    - How to contat the company: both in a separate page and in a fixed button.
    - How to request services: in a fixed button.
    - Be informed about the lastest news: in the home page.
- **SKELETON**: the information is accessed through a fixed navigation menu on top of the pages, which in addition has a button to request services.
- **SURFACE**: the website is based on green colors (to be in line with the company activity and name), contains images and a video related to its activity, and will summarise information in tables as much as possible.

## **User Goals**
- To know services being offered at a glance.
- To find a website with a simple way of requesting services.

# **3 . Design Choices**

The design was planned to cover screen sizes from 320x568px to 1920x1370px.

## **Colors**
Green is the main color of the project. The reason for this selection is to be in line with the nature of the company (whose services are focused in the current transition energy) and with the name of the company: The Green Company.

The background color is green/grey, rgb(186, 233, 227), in order to have contrast with the content of the website while keeping the green-color tendency of the design.

#### [Back to Index](#index)

## **Fonts**
Google fonts (please see credits section below) were implemented in the website. Roboto was selected for the paragraph as it is modern and easy to read. Following Google's recommendations, Baloo Tammudu 2 was also selected as complement for the titles.
Arial font is used as a back-up in case the previous fonts cannot be loaded.

Color #003300 (dark green) was selected for the body in order to have strong contrast with the white background of the body.
To differentiate the navigation menu and the request service button,  #135f13 (different dark green) is selected; while #276609 is selected to highlight all headings.

The name of the company in the logo uses #73ac3e to have a unique color.

# 9 . Bugs

The most common bugs through development were related to positioning of elements in the page. They were fixed by assigning proper values, most of them with the help of a temporaty background color for the element.

Then, many minor bugs were solved just by assigning the correct property or by trial and error.

Bugs who required more time and specific solutions are the following ones:

| Bug | Solution |
| ---- | ---- |
| aria-labelledby attribute not pointing to an local element (in current document) | Changed the attribute value to point to the ID element of the modal button in the section/project (exampleModalCenter). Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ . | 
| Stray start tag script | It was actually caused by the closing body tag placed before the end ot the HTML file, leaving some scripts tags outside the body tag. Soved by moving the closing tag to the end, just before the closing html tag. Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ .|
| Use h1 element as a top-level heading only | Change headings  from h1 and h2 to h2 and h3. olved with https://validator.w3.org/ .|
| Modal showing below other elements, in the background | Assigned z-index values to affected elements, being -1 for the modal pop-up window. |
|    The fist design of the contact form had it positioned on the right of the Contact Us page, which cause a poor responsive behaviour | Designed changed, contact form on the left, and map and contact details on the right.|
| carousel-item class with text "jumped" when changing items on Latest News section| Set height property to avoid this "jump" bahaviour. |
| Images in Our Services page carousel did not appear | Applied specificity in text carousel to select the images. |
| Text not showing in carousel for mobile screen sizes | Removed the "d-none" "d-md-block" classes from carousel items. Solved using Stack Overflow, accessed on June 22nd, 2021, at 3:46, at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42451739/bootstrap-4-carousel-caption-is-not-visible-on-small-devices .|
