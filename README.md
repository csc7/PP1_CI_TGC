# TGC - The Green Company
This website is about a fictitious company. Excpet for the contect referenced in this README file, all content is invented by me, anything matching reality is jsut a coincidence.

This repository belongs to my first milestone project in the Full-stack Development course at Code Institute, covering HTML and CSS along with Git version control and other design tools.

The live link for this projects is [this one](https://csc7.github.io/PP1_CI_TGC/).

# 2. User Experience

UX has been addressed (and remains as a constant activity) around Jesse James Garrett's process, whose five planes involves the following matters:
- STRATEGY: to build a website (product) for a company who wants to sell services.
- SCOPE: the minimum viable product needs to include features that allow the user to know the following:
    - Basic organisational information about the company.
    - Which services it provides.
    - How to contat the company.
    - How to request services.
    - Be informed about the lastest news.
- STRUCTURE: the information is structured as follows:
    - Basic organisational information about the company: in a separate page.
    - Which services it provides: in a separate page.
    - How to contat the company: both in a separate page and in a fixed button.
    - How to request services: in a fixed button.
    - Be informed about the lastest news: in the home page.
- SKELETON: the information is accessed through a fixed navigation menu on top of the pages, which in addition has a button to request services.
- SURFACE: the website is based on green colors (to be in line with the company activity and name), contains images and a video related to its activity, and will summarise information in tables as much as possible.

# 3.  Design Choices
EXPLAIN
## Colors
Green is the main color of the project. The reason for this selection is to be in line with the nature of the company (whose services are focused in the current transition energy) and with the name of the company: The Green Company.
The background color is azure in order to have contrast with the content of the website while keeping the green-color tendency of the design.
## Fonts
Google fonts, https://fonts.google.com/, were implemented in the website. Roboto was selected for the paragraph as it is modern and easy to read. Following Google's recommendations, Baloo Tammudu 2 was also selected as complement for the titles.\
Arial font is used as a back-up in case the previous fonts cannot be loaded.\
Color #003300 (dark green) was selected for the body in order to have strong contrast with the white background of the body.\
To differentiate the navigation menu and the request service button,  #135f13 (different dark green) is selected; while #276609 is selected to highlight all headings.\
The name of the company in the logo uses #73ac3e to have a unique color.
## Structure
Following expectations of the owner, the metadata includes the following keywords to help search engines to find the website: geophysics, services, modelling, acquisition, processing, wind, geothermal, carbon, capture, CO2, operations. In addition, to help find the developer and this project, the following keywords are added: Code Institute, software development, student, full-stack course, milestone project.

In order to achive the goals related to easiness and/or simplicity, a navigation area in the header is provided. In the same area, the company's logo is place to the left, and a "quick" button to request services on the right, so users are able to contract services in a very fast way.

This "quick" button, whose name is "Request Service", pops up a modal form where the user is able to contract specific services.

The body of the pages are structured as follows for each of the pages:
* Home: it contains an environmental-friendly background video with a slogan of the company and the services it offers.\
To keep navigation simple, this page is designed to fit in a screen of 1024x768 pixels withough having to scroll with the mouse.
* About Us: it has an upper section, divided in three subsections, where a picture, title and text for the following items are allocated: Mission, Values and Vision. In order to keep symmetry as accurate as possible, Values (which are shown in a list) are located in the middle.\
This section is followed, downwards, by another section (which lies in the middle of the body) that contains a table with the projects of the company.\
Finally, at the bottom of the body, there is another section that contains a table that shows the amount of people per department in the company.\
The desined is carried out for a screen size of 1024x1536 pixels (double in vertical lenght than the home page).
* Our services: it contains pictures, titles and text for each of the services being provided by the company. They are structured in a 4x4 arrange for desktop presentation, 2x8 for tablets, and 1x16 for mobile devices.\
For the desktop case, the desined is carried out for a screen size of 1024x1536 pixels (as before, double, in vertical lenght, than the home page).
* Contact Us: on the left, it has a picture of the office (above) and a location map (below). On the right, there is a form where the users are able to send consultations. It has options to avoid marketing communications and being contacted by telephone, as expected by users.\
Similar to the home page, to keep navigation simple, this page is designed to fit in a screen of 1024x768 pixels withough having to scroll with the mouse.

The footer contains links for social media, office location and company's principal e-mail of contact.\

# 7. Validation
The following errors were found and solved:

1. * Home Page:
    1.
    1.
    1.  * Error: stray end tag i - Deleted extra closing i tag.
        * Error: aria-labelledby attribute not pointing to an local element (in current document). Changed the attribute value to point to the ID element of the modal button in the section/project (exampleModalCenter).
        * Error: stray start tag script. It was actually caused by the closing body tag placed before the end ot the HTML file, leaving some scripts tags outside the body tag. Soved by moving the closing tag to the end, just before the closing html tag.
        * Warning: Use h1 element as a top-level heading only. Change headings of text above background videos from h1 and h2 to h2 and h3.

        modal in background

        positioning errors of contact form, etc.
